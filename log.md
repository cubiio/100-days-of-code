### Day 5: Sat 7-Jan-2016

**Today’s Progress**:

* For my ‘build a blog using Python’ project, I added a header, navbar and footer to the Jinja `base.html` template.

**Thoughts**:

* I gave some thought on how to develop the next level of functionality for the blog:
	* User registration
	* User login
	* User logout
* These form part of the problem sets and I will look to start coding these next week.

### Day 4: Friday, 6th January 2017
**Today's Progress**:

* Completed Udacity's User Accounts & Security module.
* Topics and code covered today include hashing and salting, and using bcrypt.

**Thoughts**:

* Interesting topic and keen to put into practice in the upcoming problem sets.

### Day 3: Thursday, 5th January 2017
**Today's Progress**:

* Finalised a basic blog using Python, Jinja and Google App Engine.
* Today I added a handler to redirect to a permalink after a post is successfully submitted.
* I also revised the Jinja templates so all the child html pages inherit from a `base.html` parent which includes a header.
* Continued my Udacity learning with User Accounts & Security module.

**Thoughts**:

* Pleasing to work through the permalink solution. The Udacity video on this was very helpful although still frustrated I couldn't work it out from the webapp2 and App Engine documentation.

### Day 2: Wednesday, 4th January 2017
**Today's Progress**:

* Built a basic blog using Python, Jinja and Google App Engine

**Thoughts**:

* All went well but got stuck on building URLs for new blog-posts. Couldn't get to grips with the documentation for Webapp2 and Google App Engine. *Frustrating*.
* Tomorrow's task is to complete the URLs and permalink, further refine my Jinja templates and add some CSS.

### Day 1: Tuesday, 3rd January 2017
**Today's Progress**:

* Udacity FSND (Full-Stack Nanodegree) Intro to Databases module:
	* More SQL (Structured Query Language) content, including the use of indices and the ACID principle
	* Started ASCII Chan mini project: Python project using Google App Engine including the Datastore, and Jinja for HTML templates

**Thoughts**:

* Useful intro to databases but also feels good to be working on a mini-project and following along with the tutor to build a web app.
* Good fun to build a first app using the Google App Engine Datastore. Next up is the database problem set so looking forward to that.

### Day 0: Monday, 2nd January 2017
**Today's Progress**:

* Udacity FSND (Full-Stack Nanodegree) Intro to Databases module.
	* Learned about SQL (Structured Query Language)
	* SQL queries in Python

**Thoughts**:

* I like the clean readability of SQL queries
* The intro course is good and it also feels like a refresher course which I like. I did the [tournament planner](https://github.com/cubiio/tournament-planner) project in PostgreSQL as part of the **Intro to Programming Nanodegree** earlier this year.

### Day -1: Sunday, 1st January 2017
**Today's Progress**:

* Completed Udacity backend problem set no 2 - user sign-up form
* Languages: Python and Jinja2 templates

**Thoughts**:

* Placing the {{variables}} in the Jinja template threw me at first as I thought  my Python code didn't work but actually it was because I had no {{ }}.
* The use of the dictionary for the params in the solution is really smart and something to read up and consider for future coding / projects.
